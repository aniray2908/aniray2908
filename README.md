## 🚀 About Me

I’m strengthening my Machine Learning foundations by combining:

- 📐 Mathematical depth (Linear Algebra, Eigen, SVD, PCA)
- 📊 Statistical learning theory
- ⚙️ MLOps & production ML systems
- 🗄️ Data engineering fundamentals

Currently working through a structured 6-week ML foundations rebuild focused on conceptual clarity and engineered implementation.

## 📌 Featured Project

### Silent Attrition Detector

Designed and built a predictive system to identify early signals of employee disengagement before formal attrition occurs.

Key aspects:

- Feature engineering from behavioral and engagement indicators
- Model training and evaluation for early risk detection
- Interpretability-focused approach for actionable insights
- Structured ML workflow from data processing to validation

This project reflects applied machine learning aligned with real-world business problems.
